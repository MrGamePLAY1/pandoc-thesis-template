\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to take a moment to give special thanks of gratitude to my supervisor and mentor Dr. Matt Smith for his dedicated work and for taking his time to guide me through this difficult project. I would also like to thank the head of informatics Daniel McSweeney for behind the scenes work that placed me in my final year of college.

I would also like to thank all the lecturers throughout my four years at TU Dublin Blanchardstown for their outstanding commitment to push and help me through the years. 

I owe deep gratitude to my family and friends which had incredible patience and inspired me to do the best I could do with my given project. 

It is an absolute privilege to thank my partner Rebecca O'Rourke and the O'Rourke household for their constant encouragement and confidence throughout the research and development of my project.
