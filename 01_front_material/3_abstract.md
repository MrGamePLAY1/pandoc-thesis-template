\chapter{Abstract}

This project spearheads the problems of poor human driving habits by building software that tracks the users' position on the road, identifying the lane lines and accurately track them and plot indicative lines for the user to follow. 

The problem with this project was how to build a software that could seamlessly work in tandem with a user operating a car and not interact with the user's steering wheel but to recommend correction suggestions, that would alert them to alter their position on the road. 

Independent research and analysis were gathered on the best ways to develop an effective approach to tackle this specific problem using the most efficient methods to gather and process such huge amounts of data. 

Key features in the development of this project include heavy use of 'Unity Game Engine' as scenes were specifically created by the user as test scenarios for the project on how well it would perform. 

As stated above the project consists of two main components:

(a) A Unity scene with multiple test scenarios which were designed for a vehicle such as a car to navigate with the aid of a navmesh AI agent. When the car navigates each test scene it gathers a number of images in the form of screenshots that would be used in the final pipeline of the project. 

(b) The other component to the project features Python code specifically designed to process the screenshots taken within the Unity test scenes and display lane lines that the software could clearly identify, this would give the ability to allow a car to self navigate a scene if it could clearly identify the lanes accurately. The software also aims to display suggestions to the user which would correct the user's position on the road.

The project has proved successful but needs more development in communications between the two systems.
