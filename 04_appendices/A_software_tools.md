- Git: A version control system - can run locally or on networked computer. There are several website that support Git projects, including:

    - Github (perhaps the most well known)
    - Gitlab
    - Bitbucket
    - you can also create and run your own Git web server ...

- Github: A commercial (but free for students!) cloud service for storing and working with projects using the Git version control system.
