Please do not confuse the following:

- Git and Github


Here is a short description of each:

- Git: A version control system - can run locally or on a networked computer. There are several websites that support Git projects, including:

    - Github (perhaps the most well known)
    - Gitlab
    - Bitbucket
    - you can also create and run your own Git web server ...

- Github: A commercial (but free for students!) cloud service for storing and working with projects using the Git version control system.

So in summary, Git and Github are commercial (but free for students!) tools that support development using Git.
