# Results

## Introduction

In this chapter, the author discusses the results discovered in the final output from the project. The author discusses the current state of the project and evaluates the project on areas that could be improved upon, from user testing. With each test scene, the algorithm will be forced to attempt and the performance is documented.

## Result

During the final build of the program, the author was satisfied that the program does what it was tasked to do. It is a stepping stone in creating a self-driving car as it can identify lane lines within the majority of situations with about 80% accuracy to correctly identifying lane lines. The algorithm struggles when navigating a busy town system, as there is a lot of weaving in and out around static objects such as people, cars, and potential roadworks. Currently, implementations of live systems recommend that their software is not recommended for busy streets and only designed for motorways or highways for perfect navigation. 

Development continued up to the last minute of the given deadline, but no progress in making the software was made in attempting to make the software more reliable in busy streets. Through all testing areas, the author received the best results from navigating a straight road which gave 100% accuracy, and the curved road network, which came in a close second position with the vertical straight road. 

The project delivers on all expected outcomes set out by the author and fits its currently designed purpose. 

## Summary

Overall the author is accepting of the current state of the project and feels happy that the work achieved is acceptable as a presentable project as a beta version of a project that could be highly expanded on upon to develop a technology capable of taking advantage of car systems to navigate street and cities itself safely.
