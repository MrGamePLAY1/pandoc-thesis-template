## Summary 

Since there was alot of graphical demand a good GPU would be required to run Unity, with everything that is going on it can slow down anything less than a desktop. A good GPU is highly recommended if a person intends on running any type of Unity enviroment. Also a top tier processing unit would be require to solve long calculations anything less than 8 cores could increase computational time to calculate any lines.
