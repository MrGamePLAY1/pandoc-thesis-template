# Methodology

## Introduction

In this section I will dicuss my methodological approach to solving the problem statement which was how to tackle poor driving behaviour behind the wheel of a vehicle and what approaches I took during my research and development of my project to develop a lane keeping system which aimed to reduce preventable car collisions on roads such as highways and urban cities. 

The core function behind lane assistive technology is to provide support to the driver by keeping them in their proper intended direction of travel [@SOC_Design]. The system uses a number of electronic components to collect data on the vehicles lateral positional on the road surface. A figure below demonstrates the effective use of a number of sensors and components used in typical use of a LKAS system. ![Structure of LKAS System](03_figures/methodology/LKAS_Diagram.png)
