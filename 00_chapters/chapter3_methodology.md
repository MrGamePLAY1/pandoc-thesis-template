# Methodology

## Introduction

In this section, I will discuss my methodological approach to solving the problem statement which was how to tackle poor driving behavior behind the wheel of a vehicle, and what approaches I took during my research and development of my project to develop a lane-keeping system which aimed to reduce preventable car collisions on roads such as highways and urban cities. 

The core function behind lane assistive technology is to provide support to the driver by keeping them in their proper intended direction of travel [@SOC_Design]. The system uses a number of electronic components to collect data on the vehicle's lateral positional on the road surface. 

For the development of my project, I make use of the Unity Game Engine which is a cross-platform engine where the user can publish to a number of marketplaces, such as iOS, Google Playstore, PSN, or the Xbox Live marketplace. The ability to monetize an application is also possible but requires multiple licenses to do so. [@technologies]

## Unity Game Engine
Unity Game Engine was the version of control within this project. With having Unity a multiple scenes could be created and gave the creator great control over all the possible parameters and acted as a great control since it was entirely ediable, the engine makes great use of C# and C++ as a programming languages to create scripts which make OOP (Object Orientated Programming) easier as everything within the engine supports the ability to attach scripts to it.

1. Assests like scene items which coudld be roads, cones, trucks, buildings are all available within the asset store. This made the creative process more exciting for the developer as the options were endless of what type of road netorks they wished to create. All assets featured in the final project were obtained from free access through the use of the Unity assest store page.
