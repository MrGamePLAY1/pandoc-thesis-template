# Future Work and Conclusions

## Introduction

This chapter talks about what the author would do if further developing the project and bring it to commercial audience. The author also mentions how they view the current state of the project and talks about their experience developing this project. The author also mentions about every hard-time face and challenges faced within the project.

## The Future

If the author was to continue the development of the project he would add the ability to potentially have all systems interconnected so it is a seamless click of a button to have the entire pipeline work and output a video of the lane lines being discovered by the software. The author would also make navigation within a city background be more accurate by potentially recording different angles or using more camera sources on the vehicle to give a 3 Dimensional position in the given space that can be mapped and updated as the object moves. The author would bring machine learning algorithms supported by deep learning done by Google to identify objects within the scenes and label them accordingly. The use of AI or deep learning would be extremely beneficial to a project like this as it could potentially store all maps known and the author could create a virtual travelable world within the Unity Game Engine system, or replicate famous cities the program could traverse and record.
