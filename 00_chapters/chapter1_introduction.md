# Introduction

## Overview and Motivation

Currently, with regards to safety among the roads, there are implementations of lane assistant
technologies already available in today's models of vehicle, which track the users' position between
road markings and can affectively stop or adjust the position of a vehicle traveling at speed, but
this technology is considered a “technology upgrade” and costs thousands to place into a vehicle,
adding sensors, cameras, accelerometers, and so on. 

My project aims to produce similar results that current technology provides but at a fraction of
the price is free to use for anyone who already drives with an on-body camera attached to their
vehicle. The motivation behind completing this project is to improve road safety among current
and future road users by making a driver more aware of how they are driving their vehicle with
regards to lane markings and distance between objects and cars in front of them.

## Aims and Objectives

### Objective 1:

Design and implement a system that takes in an image from a car-mounted camera, and then identifies the lanes within the image and any other important road markers. 

### Objective 2:

Create a set of virtual driving environments as a test set that can be evaluated using lane assist technologies. 

### Objective 3:

Create a virtual car and virtual camera, which records images every half second, which would be mounted in the windscreen of the car. 

### Objective 4:

Create an ideal AI system that will be built for the car to navigate the virtual settings for testing the software. The car will be operated in a normal fashion as if it was being operated by a human source. 

### Objective 5:

To create a real-time communication system between the car and a virtual setting and developed a system. 

### Objective 6:

To use the system components to test the lane assist system developed in this project against one or more 3rd-party lane assistive systems. 


This report described the approach taken to attempt the above objectives and concludes with an evaluation of how well each has been achieved, and recommendations for future work upon the project to complete all goals.
