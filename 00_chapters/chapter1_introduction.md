# Introduction
 
## Background
 
In recent years the number of cars on the road has been on a slow increase, due to more affordable ways of manufacturing them. With the increase of vehicles on the road car-related incidents are on the rise also. 
 
According to a study conducted by the RSA based in Ireland during the period of January - December 2020 there were a total of 137 fatal collisions which resulted in 148 on Irish roads. Which turns out to be a 6% increase of fatalities compared to provisional Garda data collected for the year of 2019 [@RSA_2021].

The (NHTSA) National Highway Transportation Safety Administration discovered that roughly 94% - 96% of all car-related crashes are down to some type of human error. Meanwhile, other studies suggest that that figure is somewhere around the 90% range. [@lc_2020]

Through a deeper investigation and analysis into this claim, it is found that a high percentage of crashes could of be adverted, as the majority of incidents reported were down to specific driver behavior in a given situation. Most of the accidents that were recorded would fall under a number of categories such as:

* Aggressive / Dangerous Driving
* Distracted Driving
* Drug / Drunk Driving
* Speeding
* Fatigued Driving

### Aggressive / Dangerous Driving

In today's version of the world with cities expanding and areas becoming more and more populated, everyone is in a rush trying to get to work or one place to another and the slightest inconvenience to someone's day could enrage them which could lead to dangerous or aggressive driving from that particular user. 

### Speeding

According to a study conducted by the (NHTSA) National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, more than 9,000 worldwide people are killed each year due to excessive speeding. [@lc_2020]

As a road user myself I have foreseen that speeding is a common practice undertaken by other road users. It is difficult not to 'normalise' speeding since it appears to be a victimless crime until it goes wrong, and when it goes wrong it could lead to a catastrophic result. It endangers everyone in the vicinity as it increases the braking distance for the vehicle but simultaneously decreases the distance from any approaching obstacles, you are effectively burning the candle at both ends. [@lc_2020] 

### Distracted Driving

With the ability to have everything on your phone in this modern era such as emails, video calls, and the ability to watch videos, you can see how much of a temptation it is for a driver to operate a vehicle and mobile device at the same time. It is common to see a user operate a mobile device while driving a vehicle and can have very serious consequences if caught doing so, but users still take the risk. 

### Drug / Drunk Driving

It is estimated in America that under the influence related crashes cost American taxpayers $44 billion each year. [@lc_2020] And that during a 15-year study conducted by S. News & World discovered that 37% of all fatal car-related crashes included at least one occupated that was intoxicated. [@lc_2020]   

### Fatigued Driving

A survey done by (NSF) Nation Sleep Foundation discovered that 41% of all drivers interviewed admitted to falling asleep at the wheel at least once in their life and that 10% reported it occurred within the past year. [@lc_2020] Even if the driver didn't fall asleep driving fatigued is like driving drunk, your reaction times are slowed and your vision is reduced.  

## Lane Keeping Assist Systems
 
 From the evidence pointed out above a system needed to be implemented to reduce the number of car-related incidents globally. This was known as (LKAS) Lane Keeping Assist System and was brought to the market in the year 2001. [@continental] The aim behind the technology is to prevent, easily preventable car-related incidents, such as driver fatigue, drug driving, distracted driving, and so on. The first car seen with an (LKAS) system on the market was seen with Nissan Motors as they revealed the first version of the technology in the most luxurious vehicle they offered at the time, the Nissan Cima.

The main function behind the LKAS system is to ensure a user of a vehicle can safely travel in between lanes and prevent accidental lane departure from user error or fatigue, it does this by slightly intervening steering if the technology notices the car is drifting horizontally. [@continental]

Since the introduction of this technology, it is estimated to reduce car-related fatalities by 12%. [@ncap_2011] The systems vary on how they work from car manufacturers, but the concept still remains the same. A combination of a camera and the infrared beam is located just behind where the front rearview mirror is located. This unit together can read any road markings and detect the distance of any car in front. With the ability to detect the road markings on the road as it sees it the camera can
distinguish behind solid white lines and broken lines. If a solid white line is detected an audible
sound will play, letting the operator of the vehicle know that they are passing this line, or a
message will be displayed on their Heads-Up Display (HUD). [@continental]

The current issue with LKAS systems is the fact that they have strict parameters which don't suit all drivers with their habits. Some drivers prefer driving closer to the centerline, some like driving directly in the middle of their given lane, and some drivers prefer to drive on the outside of the lane. This can throw off any calculated percentages for the users' position on the road and may alter the driver to false indications of wrong lane positioning, which could cause a premature intervention by software to adjust the users' position on the road to what it thinks would be more suitable, which causes a real danger on the road. A better approach for this software is for the software to learning the driving patterns of the intended user and save that to a given profile the user can select before taking off on journeys, this way the software would identify false indications by prompting questions to the user when they drive in a 'dangerous' determined by the system. 

Another issue known by the current LKAS systems is the fact that if there are poorly marked roads or for example construction zones on the road, Infiniti a car manufacturing company and user of LKAS systems stated that *"if there are no lane markers, or the system is not able to recognise the lines, the system will not function effectively"*. [@ncap_2011]


## Motivation

Currently, with regards to safety among the roads, there are implementations of lane assistant
technologies already available in today's models of vehicle, which track the users' position between
road markings and can affectively stop or adjust the position of a vehicle traveling at speed, but
this technology is considered a “technology upgrade” and costs thousands to place into a vehicle,
adding sensors, cameras, accelerometers, and so on. 

My project aims to produce similar results that current technology provides but at a fraction of
the price is free to use for anyone who already drives with an on-body camera attached to their
vehicle. The motivation behind completing this project is to improve road safety among current
and future road users by making a driver more aware of how they are driving their vehicle with
regards to lane markings and distance between objects and cars in front of them.
