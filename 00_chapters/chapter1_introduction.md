# Introduction
 
## Background
 
In recent years the number of cars on the road has been on a slow increase, due to more affordable ways of manufacturing them. With the increase of vehicles on the road car-related incidents are on the rise also. 
 
According to a study conducted by the RSA based in Ireland during the period of January - December 2020 there were a total of 137 fatal collisions which resulted in 148 on Irish roads. Which turns out to be a 6% increase of fatalities compared to provisional Garda data collected for the year of 2019 [@RSA_2021].

The (NHTSA) National Highway Transportation Safety Administration discovered that roughly 94% - 96% of all car-related crashes are down to some type of human error. Meanwhile, other studies suggest that that figure is somewhere around the 90% range. [@lc_2020]

Through a deeper investigation and analysis into this claim, it is found that a high percentage of crashes could of be adverted, as the majority of incidents reported were down to specific driver behavior in a given situation. Most of the accidents that were recorded would fall under a number of categories such as:

* Aggressive / Dangerous Driving
* Distracted Driving
* Drug / Drunk Driving
* Speeding
* Fatigued Driving

### Aggressive / Dangerous Driving

In today's version of the world with cities expanding and areas becoming more and more populated, everyone is in a rush trying to get to work or one place to another and the slightest inconvenience to someone's day could enrage them which could lead to dangerous or aggressive driving from that particular user. 

### Speeding

According to a study conducted by the (NHTSA) National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, more than 9,000 worldwide people are killed each year due to excessive speeding. [@lc_2020]

As a road user myself I have foreseen that speeding is a common practice undertaken by other road users. It is difficult not to 'normalise' speeding since it appears to be a victimless crime until it goes wrong, and when it goes wrong it could lead to a catastrophic result. It endangers everyone in the vicinity as it increases the braking distance for the vehicle but simultaneously decreases the distance from any approaching obstacles, you are effectively burning the candle at both ends.

### Distracted Driving

With the ability to have everything on your phone in this modern era such as emails, video calls, and the ability to watch videos, you can see how much of a temptation it is for a driver to operate a vehicle and mobile device at the same time. It is common to see a user operate a mobile device while driving a vehicle and can have very serious consequences if caught doing so, but users still take the risk. 

### Drug / Drunk Driving

It is estimated in America that under the influence related crashes cost American taxpayers $44 billion each year. [@lc_2020] And that during a 15-year study conducted by S. News & World discovered that 37% of all fatal car-related crashes included at least one occupated that was intoxicated. [@lc_2020]   

### Fatigued Driving

A survey done by (NSF) Nation Sleep Foundation discovered that 41% of all drivers interviewed admitted to falling asleep at the wheel at least once in their life and that 10% reported it occurred within the past year. [@lc_2020] Even if the driver didn't fall asleep driving fatigued is like driving drunk, your reaction times are slowed and your vision is reduced.
